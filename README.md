# VisualAI_hackathon_pedestrian_safety

### Probelem Statement:
Many road accidents involve pedestrians due to driver inattention or vehicle limitations in detecting obstacles. This project aims to develop a real-time pedestrian detection system using Visual AI, which can be integrated into self-driving cars, automatic braking systems, and smart traffic monitoring to enhance safety and reduce accidents.
