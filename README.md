# Detecting Debris 

**Authors**: Hrayr Muradyan, Sepehr Heydarian, Javier Martinez

### Problem Statement
Foreign Object Debris (FOD) on airport runways poses a significant risk to aircraft safety leading to tragic accidents, aircraft crashes and financial losses due to costly damage to aircraft.

The FOD-A dataset contains images of common FOD with runway and taxiway backgrounds, provides an opportunity to develop an automated computer vision-based FOD detection system. By using this dataset, our goal is to train and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately detect and classify obstacles on airport airlanes, enabling timely intervention and enhancing aviation safety.

Traditional FOD (Foreign Object Debris) detection methods have relied on manual visual inspection, where trained personnel patrol runways to spot debris. While this method is simple, cost-effective, and adaptable, it suffers from human limitations such as fatigue, environmental challenges, and inefficiency in high-traffic airports. Optical sensor systems, including high-resolution cameras and image processing algorithms, provide continuous monitoring and improve detection accuracy, but they may still struggle with false alarms and adverse weather conditions. Radar-based systems, particularly mmW radar, enhance detection in low visibility but requires sophisticated hardware and can be expensive. AI has become increasingly popular in recent years, changing various industries including safety. With advanced image processing and machine learning techniques, AI can automate FOD detection, reducing human error, improving accuracy, and working effectively in diverse lighting and weather conditions.

In this work, we aim to develop an AI model that can accurately detect FOD using machine learning and image processing techniques that will handle the limitations of the traditional methods.
